    "## Evaluation of text similarity\n",

    "We can imagine that if we use good embeddings, the cosine similarity between the duplicate sentences should be less than for the random ones. Overall, for each pair of duplicate sentences we can generate *R* random negative examples and find out the position of the correct duplicate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have the question *\"Exceptions What really happens\"* and we are sure that another question *\"How does the catch keyword determine the type of exception that was thrown\"* is a duplicate. But our model doesn't know it and tries to find out the best option also among questions like *\"How Can I Make These Links Rotate in PHP\"*, *\"NSLog array description not memory address\"* and *\"PECL_HTTP not recognised php ubuntu\"*. The goal of the model is to rank all these 4 questions (1 *positive* and *R* = 3 *negative*) in the way that the correct one is in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is unnatural to count on that the best candidate will be always in the first place. So let us consider the place of the best candidate in the sorted list of candidates and formulate a metric based on it. We can fix some *K* — a reasonalble number of top-ranked elements and *N* — a number of queries (size of the sample).\n",

    "\n",
    "where $q_i$ is the i-th query, $dup_i$ is its duplicate, $topK(q_i)$ is the top K elements of the ranked sentences provided by our model and the operation $[dup_i \\in topK(q_i)]$ equals 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise (more details about this operation could be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket)).\n",

    "### DCG@K\n",
    "The second one is a simplified [DCG metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{DCG@K} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{1}{\\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \\le K] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $rank_{dup_i}$ is a position of the duplicate in the sorted list of the nearest sentences for the query $q_i$. According to this metric, the model gets a higher reward for a higher position of the correct answer. If the answer does not appear in topK at all, the reward is zero. "
